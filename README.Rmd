## About R

- Statistical programming language
- High-level
- Versatile, robust
- Packages
- Useful for both data preparation and data analysis
- Open source
    - Meaning: source code is freely available to the public, the public can contribute
- Free




---




## The bad
 - R has a steep learning curve
 - If colleagues don't know R, this can hinder collaboration

## The good
 - R can handle larger files
 - Excel is a spreadsheet tool, errors hide
 - Reproducability, transparency
 - Advanced and versatile statistics
 - Customizable data visualizations
 
## The different (but neutral)
 - R has less formal support, but virtually endless online user community forums

## Scripts (.R) and RMarkdown files (.Rmd)

## Packages/Libraries

 - Contain numerous functions that help you complete specialized tasks
 - Anyone can make one
 - The reason R is so versatile and robust
 - Tidyverse
 - Openair
 - Many, many more


##### Installation:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# not run
install.packages("tidyverse")

```



##### Call a package or library: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Coding in R

  - Functions
  - Object names
  - Importing data
  - Calling columns in a dataframe with $
  - Storing variables, temporary objects
  - Data types
  - Data structures
  - Missing values - NA
  - Logical operators

## Functions

R has many functions built in. These are referred to as Base R functions.
When you call a function, it looks like this:

    function_name( arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2 )

You can create a function, but that's beyond the scope of our training.
You will see many examples of functions as we move forward.

## Object Names

 - Must start with a letter
 - Can contain _ and .
 - Descriptive
 - Some people use snake_case, others prefer camelCase.
 - Best practice: be consistent with naming conventions.

Example:

    my_text <- "Hello World"

## Importing data

 - CSV's are the best file format
 - Other delimited files are fine too 
 - excel workbook files can import but will complicate things

 Syntax:
     
      data <- read_csv("fileName.csv")

  - Paths to these files is necessary if you are not already pointed to your working directory (more on this later!) 
  - Many other arguments are available to specify things like whether there is a header, or if the delimiter is something other than a comma
