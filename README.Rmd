## About R

- Statistical programming language
- High-level
- Versatile, robust
- Packages
- Useful for both data preparation and data analysis
- Open source
    - Meaning: source code is freely available to the public, the public can contribute
- Free




---




## The bad
 - R has a steep learning curve
 - If colleagues don't know R, this can hinder collaboration

## The good
 - R can handle larger files
 - Excel is a spreadsheet tool, errors hide
 - Reproducability, transparency
 - Advanced and versatile statistics
 - Customizable data visualizations
 
## The different (but neutral)
 - R has less formal support, but virtually endless online user community forums

## Scripts (.R) and RMarkdown files (.Rmd)
 - 
 
 
 
 
---




## Packages/Libraries

 - Contain numerous functions that help you complete specialized tasks
 - Anyone can make one
 - The reason R is so versatile and robust
 - Tidyverse
 - Openair
 - Many, many more


##### Installation:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

# not run
install.packages("tidyverse")

```



##### Call a package or library: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Coding in R

You can use R as a calculator
    
    400 * 3 + 55.889
    2 ^ 8
    
You can create new objects with <- (which reads "gets")
    
    objectName <- value
    someText <- "Hello World"
    print(someText)

Tips:
 - Give objects short and meaningful names.
 - You can see objects you've created in the upper righthand side of your RStudio window-or the Environment
 - You can make a line into a comment by typing # in front. This is how you can add plain text or non-executable code.
 - Tip: press alt + shift + k and see what happens





---




## Functions

R has many functions built in. These are referred to as Base R functions.
When you call a function, it looks like this:

    function_name( arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2 )

You can create a function, but that's beyond the scope of our training.
You will see many examples of functions as we move forward.




---




## Object Names

 - Must start with a letter
 - Can contain _ and .
 - Descriptive
 - Some people use snake_case, others prefer camelCase.
 - Best practice: be consistent with naming conventions.

Example:

    my_text <- "Hello World"




---



## Importing data

 - CSV's are the best file format
 - Other delimited files are fine too 
 - excel workbook files can import but will complicate things

Syntax:
     
      oz_mar <- read_csv("march_ozone.csv")
Now we have a dataframe stored in the object oz_mar.

  - Paths to these files is necessary if you are not already pointed to your working directory (more on this later!) 
  - Many other arguments are available to specify things like whether there is a header, or if the delimiter is something other than a comma

## Calling columns in a dataframe with $

Example: 

    oz_mar$value
    
This would pick out the column titled "value" within the oz_mar dataframe.




---



## Storing variables, temporary objects

When you run functions in R, you have two options for handling the output:
1. Allow it to print to the console (it's not saved and you can't use it later)
    
    oz_mar$value * 0.9
    
2. Store it in an object using <- "gets"
    
    oz_control <- oz_mar$value * 0.9

## Data types

 - Character "Hello World"
 - Numeric (real or decimal) 3.14159
 - Integer 7
 - Logical TRUE



---



## Data structures

Atomic vector: the most basic data structure
    
    c(1, 4, 6, 2, 3)
    c("hello", "world", "its", "me", "jenny")

List: similar to a vector, but it can store different data types
    
    list(1, "hello", TRUE, 3.141)

Matrix: the simplest 2-dimensional data structure

    matrix(month.abb, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)

Data frame: similar to matrices, tightly couples collections of variables
    
    
Factors: a vector with ordered levels, xtremely helpful with categorical data



---



## Missing values - NA

 - R knows what a missing value is (when it's represented with NA)
 - For automatic recognition of missing values, use NA
 - Sometimes NA will be the output when an operation doesn't make sense




---



## Logical operators

You will need to use logical operators when sub-setting data and in if-statements when your scripts get more complex (we will not cover if-statements in this training)
 - "not" = !
 - "and" for vectors > length-1 = &
 - "and" for single, scalar objects = &&
 - "or" for vectors > length-1 = |
 - "or" for single, scalar objects = ||
 - exclusive "or" = xor(x, y)
 - isNA() checks if an object is NA and returns TRUE or FALSE

## Best practices
- R Projects vs. working directories
- Debugging
